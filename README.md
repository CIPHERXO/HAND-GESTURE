# HAND-GESTURE
Gesture recognition is technology that uses sensors to read and interpret hand movements as commands
Gesture recognition is technology that uses sensors to read and interpret hand movements as commands. In the automotive industry, this capability allows drivers and passengers to interact with the vehicle â€” usually to control the infotainment system without touching any buttons or screens.

Aptiv developed the technology behind the first gesture recognition system for automotive applications, introduced in the BMW 7 Series in 2015, which can recognize hand gestures that control music/audio and incoming calls.

As the technology matures, gesture recognition will move beyond infotainment and will allow drivers to control other systems within the vehicle, such as heating and cooling, and to connect with smart home systems. For example, imagine being able to check your home security camera as you drive home by simply making a hand gesture. Gestures could also be coupled with telematics systems, allowing the vehicle to provide information about nearby landmarks if it recognizes that an occupant is pointing at it.
